# System Architecture Overview

## About MyComputer's Architecture

This document explains the architectural decisions, patterns, and principles that underpin MyComputer's enterprise computer repair management system. Understanding these concepts helps teams make informed decisions about system changes and improvements.

## Architectural Philosophy

### Microservices Architecture

MyComputer follows a microservices architecture pattern, where each major business capability is implemented as an independent service. This decision was made for several important reasons:

**Why Microservices?**
The computer repair business has distinct domains - inventory management, customer relationships, payment processing, and location services. Each domain has different scaling requirements, update frequencies, and business criticality. By separating these into microservices, we can:

- Scale services independently based on demand
- Deploy updates without affecting the entire system
- Use different technologies where appropriate
- Assign specialized teams to specific services
- Isolate failures to prevent system-wide outages

**Trade-offs**
While microservices provide flexibility, they also introduce complexity in service communication, data consistency, and operational overhead. We manage these challenges through service mesh patterns, eventual consistency models, and comprehensive monitoring.

### Event-Driven Communication

Services communicate through both synchronous REST APIs and asynchronous event streams. This hybrid approach balances immediate consistency needs with system resilience.

**Synchronous Communication**
Used for:
- User-facing operations requiring immediate feedback
- Simple CRUD operations
- Health checks and status queries

**Asynchronous Communication**
Used for:
- Order processing workflows
- Inventory updates across locations
- Payment reconciliation
- Report generation

The event-driven pattern allows services to remain loosely coupled while maintaining data consistency through eventual consistency patterns.

## Domain-Driven Design

### Bounded Contexts

Each service represents a bounded context with clear boundaries:

1. **Inventory Context**: Manages parts, stock levels, and supplier relationships
2. **Customer Context**: Handles customer data, preferences, and interaction history
3. **Payment Context**: Processes transactions, refunds, and financial reporting
4. **Location Context**: Manages geographic data and service area coverage

These boundaries were established through extensive domain modeling with business stakeholders, ensuring that each service encapsulates a coherent set of business capabilities.

### Aggregates and Entities

Within each bounded context, we identify aggregates that maintain consistency boundaries:

- **Inventory Aggregate**: Item → Stock Level → Warehouse Location
- **Customer Aggregate**: Customer → Contact Info → Service History
- **Payment Aggregate**: Transaction → Line Items → Payment Method
- **Location Aggregate**: Service Center → Coverage Area → Technicians

## Data Architecture

### Database per Service

Each microservice owns its database, following the database-per-service pattern. This provides:

- **Data Encapsulation**: Services don't share database schemas
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate database
- **Independent Scaling**: Databases can be scaled based on service needs
- **Fault Isolation**: Database issues affect only one service

### Data Consistency Patterns

**Immediate Consistency**
Critical operations like payment processing use distributed transactions with two-phase commit when necessary.

**Eventual Consistency**
Non-critical updates use event sourcing and CQRS patterns:
- Events are published when state changes
- Other services subscribe and update their local views
- Compensation transactions handle failures

### Data Synchronization

Cross-service data needs are handled through:
1. **API Composition**: Aggregating data from multiple services
2. **Data Replication**: Maintaining read-only copies for queries
3. **Event Streaming**: Real-time data synchronization via Kafka/Kinesis

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

1. **Network Level**: VPC isolation, security groups, NACLs
2. **Application Level**: JWT authentication, OAuth 2.0 authorization
3. **Data Level**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Operational Level**: Audit logging, anomaly detection

### Zero Trust Model

We assume no implicit trust:
- Every request is authenticated and authorized
- Service-to-service communication uses mTLS
- Principle of least privilege for all access
- Regular rotation of credentials and certificates

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling

All services are designed for horizontal scaling:
- **Stateless Services**: No session affinity required
- **Load Distribution**: Round-robin with health checks
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics

### Caching Strategy

Multiple caching layers optimize performance:
1. **CDN Level**: Static assets and API responses
2. **Application Level**: Redis for session and query caching
3. **Database Level**: Query result caching
4. **Client Level**: Browser and mobile app caching

### Database Scaling

Different strategies for different data types:
- **Transactional Data**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Analytical Data**: Data warehouse with columnar storage
- **Geographic Data**: Spatial indexing and partitioning
- **Time-series Data**: Time-based partitioning and archival

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker

Prevents cascade failures:
```
Closed → Open (on threshold) → Half-Open (after timeout) → Closed/Open
```

Services implement circuit breakers for all external dependencies, preventing failed services from overwhelming the system.

### Retry with Backoff

Transient failures are handled with exponential backoff:
- Initial retry: 100ms
- Maximum retry: 10 seconds
- Maximum attempts: 5
- Jitter added to prevent thundering herd

### Bulkhead Pattern

Resource isolation prevents total system failure:
- Connection pool isolation per dependency
- Thread pool isolation for different operation types
- Rate limiting per client and operation

## Deployment Architecture

### Blue-Green Deployments

Zero-downtime deployments through:
1. Deploy new version to green environment
2. Run smoke tests and validation
3. Switch traffic from blue to green
4. Keep blue environment for quick rollback

### Canary Releases

Gradual rollout for risk mitigation:
- 5% traffic to new version initially
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Gradually increase to 25%, 50%, 100%
- Automatic rollback on anomalies

### Feature Flags

Decouple deployment from release:
- Deploy code with features disabled
- Enable features for specific users/groups
- A/B testing for new features
- Quick disable without deployment

## Observability Architecture

### Three Pillars of Observability

1. **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements over time
2. **Logs**: Discrete events with context
3. **Traces**: Request flow across services

### Correlation and Context

All telemetry includes:
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Business context (customer, order, location)
- Technical context (service, version, instance)

This enables rapid problem diagnosis and business impact assessment.

## Technology Decisions

## Evolution and Future Considerations

### Planned Improvements

2. **GraphQL Gateway**: Unified API for client applications
3. **Machine Learning**: Predictive maintenance and demand forecasting
4. **Edge Computing**: Local processing for offline capability

### Technical Debt Management
