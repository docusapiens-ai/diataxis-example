## Communication Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Communication (REST APIs)

#### Customer Base → Other Services
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant CustomerBase
    participant Inventory
    participant Payments
    participant Locations
    
    Customer->>CustomerBase: Create Repair Order
    CustomerBase->>Locations: Get Nearest Location
    Locations-->>CustomerBase: Location Details
    CustomerBase->>Inventory: Check Parts Availability
    Inventory-->>CustomerBase: Parts Status
    CustomerBase->>Payments: Initialize Payment
    Payments-->>CustomerBase: Payment Token
    CustomerBase-->>Customer: Order Confirmed
```

#### Payments → Other Services
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant Payments
    participant CustomerBase
    participant Inventory
    
    Customer->>Payments: Process Payment
    Payments->>CustomerBase: Verify Customer
    CustomerBase-->>Payments: Customer Valid
    Payments->>Inventory: Reserve Items
    Inventory-->>Payments: Items Reserved
    Payments->>Payments: Process Transaction
    Payments-->>Customer: Payment Confirmed
```

### 2. Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)

#### Order Processing Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Event Flow"
        ORDER_CREATED[Order Created Event]
        PAYMENT_PROCESSED[Payment Processed Event]
        INVENTORY_UPDATED[Inventory Updated Event]
        LOCATION_ASSIGNED[Location Assigned Event]
    end
    
    ORDER_CREATED -->|CustomerBase| EVENT_BUS
    EVENT_BUS -->|Subscribe| PAYMENTS
    EVENT_BUS -->|Subscribe| INVENTORY
    EVENT_BUS -->|Subscribe| LOCATIONS
    
    PAYMENTS -->|Publish| PAYMENT_PROCESSED
    INVENTORY -->|Publish| INVENTORY_UPDATED
    LOCATIONS -->|Publish| LOCATION_ASSIGNED
```

## API Dependencies Matrix

| Service | Depends On | Depended By | Critical Dependencies |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Customer Base | Inventory, Payments, Locations | Payments | Payments (for orders) |
| Inventory | Locations | Customer Base, Payments | None (can operate independently) |
| Payments | Customer Base, Inventory, Stripe | Customer Base | Stripe (external) |
| Locations | Geocoding | Customer Base, Inventory | None (can operate independently) |

## Event Catalog

### Business Events

| Event | Publisher | Subscribers | Payload |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `order.created` | Customer Base | Inventory, Payments, Locations | Order details, customer ID |
| `payment.processed` | Payments | Customer Base, Inventory | Transaction ID, amount, status |
| `inventory.reserved` | Inventory | Payments, Customer Base | Items, quantities, location |
| `inventory.updated` | Inventory | Customer Base, Locations | Item ID, stock levels |
| `location.capacity.changed` | Locations | Customer Base, Inventory | Location ID, new capacity |
| `appointment.scheduled` | Locations | Customer Base | Appointment details |
| `customer.updated` | Customer Base | Payments | Customer ID, changed fields |
| `refund.initiated` | Payments | Customer Base, Inventory | Transaction ID, reason |

### System Events

| Event | Publisher | Subscribers | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `service.health.check` | All Services | Monitoring | Health status reporting |
| `cache.invalidated` | Any Service | Cache Manager | Cache synchronization |
| `config.updated` | Config Service | All Services | Configuration changes |
| `alert.triggered` | Monitoring | Operations Team | System alerts |

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breakers

Each service implements circuit breakers for external dependencies:

```yaml
Customer Base:
  - Inventory API: 5 failures in 60s opens circuit
  - Payments API: 3 failures in 30s opens circuit
  - Locations API: 5 failures in 60s opens circuit

Payments:
  - Stripe API: 3 failures in 30s opens circuit
  - Customer Base API: 5 failures in 60s opens circuit

Inventory:
  - Locations API: 5 failures in 60s opens circuit

Locations:
  - Geocoding API: 10 failures in 120s opens circuit
```

### Fallback Strategies

| Service | Dependency | Fallback Strategy |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Customer Base | Inventory | Show cached availability |
| Customer Base | Locations | Use default location |
| Payments | Stripe | Queue for retry |
| Locations | Geocoding | Use cached coordinates |
| Inventory | Locations | Assume all locations |

## Security Boundaries

### Service-to-Service Authentication

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "mTLS Communication"
        SERVICE_A[Service A]
        SERVICE_B[Service B]
        CERT_A[Certificate A]
        CERT_B[Certificate B]
        CA[Certificate Authority]
    end
    
    CA -->|Issues| CERT_A
    CA -->|Issues| CERT_B
    SERVICE_A -->|Presents| CERT_A
    SERVICE_B -->|Validates| CERT_A
    SERVICE_B -->|Presents| CERT_B
    SERVICE_A -->|Validates| CERT_B
```

### API Gateway Security

- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests/minute per API key
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Requirements

| Communication Path | Max Latency | Current p99 |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Customer Base → Inventory | 200ms | 145ms |
| Customer Base → Payments | 500ms | 380ms |
| Customer Base → Locations | 150ms | 120ms |
| Payments → Stripe | 2000ms | 1500ms |
| Locations → Geocoding | 1000ms | 750ms |

### Throughput Capacity

| Service | Peak TPS | Sustained TPS | Auto-scale Trigger |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Customer Base | 5000 | 2000 | 70% CPU |
| Inventory | 3000 | 1500 | 70% CPU |
| Payments | 2000 | 1000 | 60% CPU |
| Locations | 4000 | 2000 | 70% CPU |

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing

All inter-service communications include:
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for the entire request chain
- **Span ID**: Identifier for individual service operations
- **Parent Span ID**: Links to calling service
- **Baggage**: Business context (customer ID, order ID)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Inter-service latency | < 200ms p99 | > 500ms |
| Circuit breaker trips | < 1/hour | > 5/hour |
| Event processing lag | < 5 seconds | > 30 seconds |
| API error rate | < 0.1% | > 1% |

## Deployment Coordination

### Service Dependencies for Deployment

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Deployment Order"
        SHARED[Shared Services<br/>Config, Secrets, Auth]
        LOCATIONS[Locations Service<br/>No dependencies]
        INVENTORY[Inventory Service<br/>Depends on Locations]
        CUSTOMER[Customer Base<br/>Depends on Locations, Inventory]
        PAYMENTS[Payments Service<br/>Depends on Customer Base]
    end
    
    SHARED --> LOCATIONS
    LOCATIONS --> INVENTORY
    INVENTORY --> CUSTOMER
    CUSTOMER --> PAYMENTS
```

### Version Compatibility Matrix

| Service | Current Version | Compatible With |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Customer Base | v2.3.0 | Inventory v2.x, Payments v3.x, Locations v1.x |
| Inventory | v2.1.0 | Customer Base v2.x, Locations v1.x |
| Payments | v3.0.1 | Customer Base v2.x, Inventory v2.x |
| Locations | v1.5.0 | All versions |

## Disaster Recovery

### Service Recovery Priority

1. **Priority 1**: Payments (Revenue critical)
2. **Priority 2**: Customer Base (Customer facing)
3. **Priority 3**: Inventory (Operations critical)
4. **Priority 4**: Locations (Support function)

### Data Synchronization Recovery

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Recovery Process"
        RESTORE[Restore from Backup]
        REPLAY[Replay Events]
        RECONCILE[Reconcile Data]
        VALIDATE[Validate Consistency]
    end
    
    RESTORE --> REPLAY --> RECONCILE --> VALIDATE
```

## Future Integration Plans

### Planned Integrations

1. **Analytics Service**: Real-time business intelligence
2. **ML Service**: Predictive maintenance and demand forecasting
3. **Mobile Backend**: Dedicated mobile API gateway
4. **Partner API**: B2B integration platform
